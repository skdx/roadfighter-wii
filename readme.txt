  --  INSTRUCTIONS  --

To play RoadFighter, just execute the RoadFighter.exe executable file. The main
menu can be browsed using cursor keys, space and the escape keys:

- cursor up/cursor down: browsing among options
- space/cursor right: selecting an option
- escape/cursor left: go to the previous menu

To play the game, just select 1 or 2 players. Then you can choose a game level:

- GAME A: For novices. You may want to play in this mode the first time you play
          the game.
- GAME B: For advanced players. The game is quite hard to complete in this
          game level.
- GAME C: For crazy players. In this game levels, you will have _serious_
          problems to end the game.


In Road Fighter you drive a car. It is a death-race between you and a group of
crazy drivers. To play the game, you just need three keys: left, right and 
accelerate. All three can be redefined in the main menu. 
During the game, you can go back to the main menu by pressing the escape key.
You can press the backspace key if you want to restart a game.
To puse the game press F1

The game is divided in 6 stages. In each stage, the goal is to reach the 
checkpoints before your car runs out of fuel. Easy? You may think so, but there
are many obstacles between your car and the checkpoints:

- Green cars: these drivers are unlucky enough to be on the
              same road where your crazy race is taking place.
- Blue cars: your adversaries, you can usually go faster than them. But don't be
			 so sure, they can surprise you!
- Pink cars: suicide drivers. These cars will try to crash into you when you
		     pass them.
- Trucks: you'd better avoid them
- Water: will brake your car
- Oil: wil make your car skid
- Rocks: you shouldn't crash on a rock... if you can!

During the race, you should try not to hit the borders of the road. But
some of the other cars will try to make you crash...

Another important issue is the fuel. You should try to collect all the fuel
recharges that you can during the game. They are represented by the pink hearts.
